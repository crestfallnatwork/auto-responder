This application uses no external libraries. Just plain old Node.
For sending requests the node fetch API is used.
Other than that the app makes use of node's filesystem APi(reading configs, auth info and such) and the HTTP API(server for OAuth2 redirect)

For the application of this size and functionality, I think there is no need for external dependencies.
