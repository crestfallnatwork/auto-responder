For starters more documentation, error checking and testing.
In the code I have marked places for improvement with comments
One major improvement could be to use Google's SDK which could streamline much of the code. This was mainly skipped due to my incompetence with the said SDK and me wanting to keep this project dependency free.

Other than that some features could be also added, in no particular order these are:
* Some way to generate better email templates
* Using a push notification model instead of the polling model currently used.
* Ability to auto respond to multiple emails instead of just one.
* Better replies, maybe autogenerated with some sort of generative AI, like OpenAI's GPT. (This could be actually be a pretty good idea, summarize the mail and present an autogenerated response )
